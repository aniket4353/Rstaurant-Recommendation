long time to get the order as they were very busy with hookah pots and even after that had to remind them thrice to get water and ketchupnOrderednHoney Chilli Potatoes which were absolutely delicious

the right amount of spicy tangy and a slight hint of prawns at the end It doesnt taste or smell fishy considering it has a seafood base The milejule kebabs offers an interesting mix of flavours saucy lolipops to the sauted chicken chunks with veggies Even the tandoori and hariyali kebabs are wellmarinated and the meat is tender as well This a good menu that plays around with classic chats tandoori and kebab starters You have just as many veg options as nonveg both in starters as well as main coursennColorful walls and a vibrant ambience the place is done up really well with bright colours and graffiti Its a good place if you are looking for hookah cheap alcohol and a wide choice of veg and nonveg starters all under one roof Rated 30 RATEDn  This is essentially an establishment for cheap

well maybe youd have liked it I certainly didnt but its fine not their fault It had a paneer sabzi which was above average at taste portion size was good tho it had only 4 small pieces of paneer in it now thats where everything good with the thali stops The dry sabzi was of karela i hate karela so that went to waste another gravy sabzi was of soya balls I didnt like them either Dal reminded me of the dal served in my college hostel  engineering college hostel so do the maths  There was no sweet in the thali packed so that was another bummer Salad size was okay ish There were 3 plain rotis tho

this outlet The menu was having many fried Chicken options and also some rice combo options which make it bit different from other fried Chicken outlets in the townnnWe ordered their spicy fried Chicken for two people and it was warm by the time it reached usnThe fried chicken were good in taste but one piece was totally waste as there was no chicken inside it and it was only a big block of the cripsy part with a very small piece of chickennSo that was something that we have to throw otherwise the other pieces were good and the taste was also good\"\n        ],\n
